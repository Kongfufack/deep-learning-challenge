    "1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?\n",
    "Answer: For the neural network model, three hidden layers were selected with 150, 75, and 30 neurons respectively.\n",
    "The ReLU activation function was used for the hidden layers due to its efficiency in dealing with the vanishing gradient problem. The output layer used the sigmoid activation function because our model is a binary classifier, and sigmoid function outputs probabilities which is ideal for binary classification.\n",

    "2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?\n",
    "Answer: The initial model achieved an accuracy of around 72.7%. And I tried to add the layers and neurons to improve the model performance. However, the model performance did not improve at all. Don't know why.\n",

    "3. What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?\n",
    "Answer: I tried: \n",

    "2. Added a third hidden layer.\n",

I also tried to increase the epochs from 50 to 100 and then to 200, and the result still the same. I don't know why the model performance did not improve at all.\n",
